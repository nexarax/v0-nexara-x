Subject: 🚀 I Just Launched NexaraX - Your AI Social Media Empire

Hey [Name],

After 6 months of building in secret, I'm finally ready to share what I've been working on.

NexaraX is live. And it's about to change everything.

🤖 What is NexaraX?
It's the first AI platform that creates viral content for Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, and LinkedIn - completely automatically.

While you sleep, work, or relax, your AI is:
• Creating viral posts
• Scheduling optimal posting times  
• Growing your following
• Building your personal brand

🎯 Why I Built This:
I was spending 4+ hours daily creating content. Now my AI does it in 4 minutes.

Last month alone, my AI-generated content got:
• 2.3M views across platforms
• 15K new followers
• £8,500 in business inquiries

💰 The Business Model:
• Free Plan: 5 AI posts/month
• Pro Plan: £29/month for unlimited everything
• Built for £0 using free tiers and smart architecture

🚀 Launch Special (Next 48 Hours):
• 14-day free trial (no credit card)
• First 100 users get lifetime 50% discount
• Personal onboarding call with me
